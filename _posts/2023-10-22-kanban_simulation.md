# Introduction to Kanban

There are several different Agile approaches: Scrum, Kanban...

The term Kanban is famous in the car industry, It was invented for Toyota in Japan.
The term Kanban used for knowledge work has nothing to do with Industrial Kanban!

> Kanban is a way of seeing work  - Andy Carminchael

We need a work flow, and if the work flows, It will get finished. (which is good)
Kanban is a way to see work and finish it.

First used in Microsoft and Yahoo. Now we use Kanban everyday:
- in a parking garage: imagine a 100 car parking fully filled with cars. When the 101 car will enter, doors won't open. So It's standing there waiting for a car to enter. This is a `pull` system which is different form a `push` system (when the car enters, one gets pushed out).
- at work: companies are `pushing`  work to people which not always can `pull`. Kanban wants to avoid this.

## Kanban is a method to manage knowledge work,
with Principles and Practices to guide you in managing and improving work, using Kanban Boards to visualise the work.
> X-Box used Kanban.

# The Simulation

The Board is divided in Options, Design, Implementation and Done. The goal is to move as many noes from options to done. When we move a note from options, we write our initials on the top left, the starting date on the top right. When It gets done, we write the date below the starting day.
If a note is blocked, we put a B in the lower left corner. When It is blocked, we can't move it. We can unblock It.

# Statistical Analysis

Time of completion for each task before task limit:


Time of completion for each task after task limit:

When we assigned limits to the number of tasks, the whole team started to cooperate and the time to complete was much shorter.

> There is no connection between delivering fast and bad quality

**If you do less things at a time and you focus on that, you are fast and quality is great. If you have too many things, It will wither too slow or quality will be bad.**

Agile = being able to adapt, you are increasing your livability by changing. Delivering early and quickly to get feedback.

Paradigm of Corporate Work

If we are all 100% busy, work will be done. This way we are optimising resources.
We make software for that, Microsoft Project and Oracle Primavera work like that.

But think of a road and traffic: If the road is full, It won't flow as fast as if It has less cars.
Kanban; if we all are 100% busy, we don't become faster. The important thing is to get thing done.
Kanban has another attitude towards human beings: Manage the Work, not the Workers.

> We don't have time to fix the fence, we are too busy catching the chicken

## Slack is the ultimate weapon of productivity

You are working on the system, rather than in the system.
